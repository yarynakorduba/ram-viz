# About the project

This is an interactive article explaining how computer Random Access Memory (RAM) works. The article explains the concepts of reading and writing to RAM, as well as RAM latency, clock timings, and RAS / CAS. The article is followed by an interactive playground where users can try to "read" and "write" the data to the memory matrix.

Deployed version of the project can be found [here](https://yarynakorduba.github.io/ram-viz/).
